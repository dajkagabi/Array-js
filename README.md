reate an Array

One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets []. Remember from the previous exercise, arrays can store any data type — we can have an array that holds all the same data types or an array that holds different data types. 

Let’s take a closer look at the syntax in the array example:

    The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
    
    Each content item inside an array is called an element.
    
    There are three different elements inside the array.
    
    Each element inside the array is a different data type
